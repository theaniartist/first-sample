# WL-Summer-OOP-And-More


This learning experience provides a look at how an individual with some
foundation will learn some more intermediate level CS content. In addition,
this is an attempt to promote good practices with relatively standard
procedures.

## Table of Contents

1. Simple Practice


    Dedicated programs intended to act as assessments or provide means to gain
familiarity with a certain concept. These will tend to be short with more
relaxed standards. They will also be broken into categories which describe
the main focus of the program. This organization will help prioritize which
aspects of the code should be inspected with the most scrutiny.

2. Main Project


    A large collaborative program with some set goal. While the main
functionality will be implemented together, any parts deemed trivial or out of
scope will be provided. There are full intentions to have a runnable project
that could be explained and documented by all parties within a few weeks time.
